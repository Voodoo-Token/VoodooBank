# Voodoo Bank

The Voodoo Bank is a decentralized application (DApp) within the Voodoo Token ecosystem on PulseChain, designed as a bank by offering digital safe deposit boxes for long-term token holders. It enables users to lock up their Voodoo Tokens (VDO) for extended periods; 1, 5, or 10 years, and earn additional Voodoo Tokens as rewards for their commitment.

## Overview

The Voodoo Bank provides a DeFi solution for those seeking to hold Voodoo tokens long-term and earn passive income. By locking tokens for set durations, users not only help stabilize the token’s supply but also receive extra Voodoo Tokens as an incentive. This mechanism encourages holding and supports the overall health and value appreciation of the Voodoo Token ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Long-Term Locking:** Choose between 1, 5, or 10-year lock-up periods.
- **Earn Rewards:** Receive additional Voodoo Tokens as a reward for your commitment.
- **Decentralized & Trustless:** All operations are handled by smart contracts on PulseChain.
- **No KYC Required:** Completely permissionless, no sign-up or identity verification needed.
- **Low Fees:** PulseChain’s fast and cheap transactions make locking and claiming efficient and affordable
